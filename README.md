    War

  Trump is thinking...


  President Trump's Reponse: 

    Let me tell you...War, this is a big issue folks.  They are doing everything they can.  My friend, who is a rich lawyer told me all
    about it.  I don't know, but that is what people are telling me.  I am going to make America great again.  War...Yeah, I know it is a
    problem.  I have a plan.  A plan so good that I can't say because then they will know.  We will win, and keep winning.  They won't
    know what to do because we will be winning so much!  I don't know, but that is what people are telling me.

    Global Warming 

  Trump is thinking...


  President Trump's Reponse: 

    You know a lot of people have been talking about this.  We can't ignore Global Warming.  This is a massive problem.  This is serious
    folks.  My friend, who is a really, really smart business man told me all about it.  I don't know, but that is what people are telling
    me.  We have a real problem.  You know you can't solve a problem until you find out what's the root cause.  My friends, they already
    called me to thank me for looking into this.  Global Warming...They know it's a real problem.  I have a plan and it's going to be big.
    This is huge.
