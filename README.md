    Let me tell you...War, this is a big issue folks.  They are doing everything they can.  My friend, who is a rich lawyer told me all about it.  I don't know, but that is what people are telling me.  I am going to make America great again.  War...Yeah, I know it is a problem.  I have a plan.  A plan so good that I can't say because then they will know.  We will win, and keep winning.  They won't know what to do because we will be winning so much!  I don't know, but that is what people are telling me.
